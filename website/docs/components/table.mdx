> A table allows users to view data organized in rows and columns and in some cases perform actions on it.

## Anatomy

1. Header Row
1. Rows
1. Columns
1. A container
1. Sort (optional)
1. Scrolling (optional)

## Usage

Use a table to organize and display long lists of data or content, or to help users find a specific piece of information in a large data set.

- Columns should be in a logical order from left to right based on the content. The farthest left content column should meaningfully label the row. For example, in a student set the first column should be the student's name.
- Search and filters can be used in conjunction with tables to help users find information
- Table content can include:
  - Text
  - Numbers
  - Checkboxes or radio buttons
  - Custom content, such as buttons
- Checkboxes or radio buttons should be the farthest left column. They're used to take bulk actions on the selected items in a table.
- Tables must have at least 2 columns.
- Column titles in the header row should be as short as possible but can wrap to 2 rows and then truncate if necessary.
- Table content should ideally fit on one row but may wrap to multiple lines.
- The data within the table should be related in a meaningful way.
- Column titles should accurately label the data within the column, and include units of measurement in the column title if applicable.
- All content within a column is the same level of hierarchy as all other content within that column. A table shouldn't be used to communicate hierarchy.
- If a table has no content, it should display an empty state or not display the table at all.
- Use an alternating striped background for tables with a lot of complex data to help users keep track of the rows.
