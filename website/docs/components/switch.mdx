1. **Label** - a short name that lets the user know what the switch will turn on or off.
1. **Description** (_optional_) - a description that can be used to add clarity to the role of the switch.
1. **Control** - an indicator that lets the user know the current state of the switch.

## Usage

- When a user toggles a switch, its corresponding action takes effect right away.
- A switch has two mutually exclusive states&mdash;on and off.

:::tip Do
- Do use a switch to mimic a physical on/off switch in the interface.
- Do allow users to select the switch by clicking the control or its text label.
:::

:::danger Don't
- Don’t use the words "on/off" in the switch’s text label. The option that the switch controls should be clear from its label. A tooltip/title attribute may be added to convey the on/off state.
- Don’t use a switch if the option is part of a larger flow, with a final confirmation step or Submit button. Use a [checkbox](checkbox) instead.
- Don’t use a switch if users can select multiple options from a list. Use [checkboxes](checkbox) instead.
