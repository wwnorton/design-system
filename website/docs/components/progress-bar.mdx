> A progress bar lets the user know that something is processing or progressing.

## Anatomy

1. **Track** - a fixed width track for the progress indicator to travel along.
1. **Progress indicator** - an animated bar that conveys processing or progress toward completion.
1. **Label** - a description of what is progressing.

## Usage

<Callout title="Indeterminate vs. Determinate">

The progress bar is said to be in "indeterminate" mode if it does not have a set value.
This conveys to users that something is processing without conveying how close to being done it is.

<div className="callout__example">
	<ProgressBar label="Loading..." />
</div>

When a progress bar does have a set value, it is said to be in "determinate" mode.
This gives the user a better sense of how close it is to beng complete.

<div className="callout__example">
	<ProgressBar label="Downloading..." progress={0.35} />
</div>

</Callout>

## React API

We expose one component for the progress bar API, the [ProgressBar](https://github.com/wwnorton/design-system/tree/main/packages/react/src/components/ProgressBar).

### ProgressBar

The `ProgressBar` component extends the `React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>` interface.

```js
import { ProgressBar } from '@wwnds/react';
```

```tsx live
/* set progress to a value between 0 and 1 to make determinate */
<ProgressBar label="Loading..." progress={undefined} />
```

<PropsTable from={ProgressBar} />
