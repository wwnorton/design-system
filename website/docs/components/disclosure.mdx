> A disclosure allows the user to show and hide additional content.

## Anatomy

![An expanded disclosure with labels pointing to the summary button, a downward facing icon indicating: summary marker, and body text](/img/Anatomy_Disclosure.png)

1. **Summary Button** - a button used to summarize what is conveyed in the disclosure body.
	1. **Summary Marker** - a visual indicator of the disclosure state.
1. **Body** - displays the content when expanded and hides the content when collapsed.

## Usage

- Use a disclosure when you want to help the users manage their attention on the page.
	:::note Why
	A disclosure helps the user scan content by keeping the primary information visible, allowing them to focus on what’s most relevant.
	:::
- A disclosure has two states: collapsed and expanded. A disclosure is collapsed by default.
- A disclosure’s summary button should clearly and succinctly describe its hidden content, allowing users to quickly identify relevant sections without needing to expand every disclosure.
- Ensure that the entire summary button is selectable.
	:::note Why
	Expanding the target area improves usability, making it easier for users to interact with the disclosure, especially on touch devices.
	:::
- If multiple related disclosures are needed, use an (accordion).


:::danger Don't
- Don't nest disclosures within each other.
	- **Why:** Nested disclosures are difficult to navigate and not easily accessible.
- Don’t use a disabled disclosure when there is no content to reveal.
	- **Why:** A disabled disclosure can confuse users, making them wonder if something is broken or missing.
