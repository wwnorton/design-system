> A tooltip displays the name of or description for a related element on demand.

## Anatomy

1. **Text** - tooltip text names or describes a related element.
	- If the related element does not have a name, the tooltip text is used to name it.
	- If the related element already has a name, the tooltip text is used to add description to the related element.
1. **Arrow** - a visual indicator that points to the related element.

## Usage

Use tooltips when there is not enough physical space to display the name or description of an interactive element.
Tooltips provide a mechanism for a simplifying the visual design of an interface.
But in exchange, users will have a harder time understanding and discovering the role of the tooltipped element, so use them sparingly and thoughtfully.

## Naming and describing

In the Norton design system, a tooltip can only be used to [name](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#accessible_names)
or [describe](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#accessible_descriptions) its related element.
This restriction ensures that the user experience of the tooltip is consistent for everyone.

### Naming

A tooltip is said to be **naming** its related element when it is acting as a label for that element.
For instance, an icon button's call to action could be captured as a tooltip to ensure that the purpose of the icon button is clear to everyone.
If the element contains textual content and you also want to use a tooltip to add additional context, the tooltip should be a describing tooltip.

:::a11y Naming tooltips & screen reader experience
When a tooltip **names** its related element, screen readers will read the value of the tooltip when they encounter the related element, entirely ignoring any textual content inside the element.
For this reason, naming tooltips should only be used for elements that do not already contain textual content.
:::

### Describing

A tooltip is said to be **describing** its related element when it is acting as additional or supplemental information about an element that already has a name.
For instance, an `<input>` that already has an associated `<label>` could use a tooltip to display help text about the expected input format.

:::a11y Describing tooltips & screen reader experience
When a tooltip **describes** its related element, many screen readers will read the name of the related element, pause briefly, and then read the description contained in the tooltip.
