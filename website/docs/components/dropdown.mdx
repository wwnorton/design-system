> A dropdown allows the user to select an option from a list of options in an expandable overlay.

## Anatomy

1. **Label** - a short description or prompt that lets the user what they will be selecting.
1. **Button** - a button that opens the dropdown listbox and displays the currently selected option.
	- Default text before selection should be "Select".
	- An icon should be displayed to the right of the button's text to convey whether the dropdown listbox is open or closed.
1. **Listbox** - a container for the list of options which only appears when opened by the dropdown button.
1. **Selected option** - the currently selected option.
1. **Options** - the available options. Clicking an unselected option will select that option, deselect the currently selected option, and close the listbox.

## Usage

- Use a dropdown to select one option from a collapsed set of available options.
- By default, dropdown options are mutually exclusive. The user can only select 1 option.
- When an option is selected, the dropdown closes and the selected option updates to display that item.
- On load, the dropdown should display default text of `"Select"`. The user should be able to change it back to `"Select"` if they wish.
- <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd>/<kbd>Up Arrow</kbd> moves focus to the next/previous options, respectively.
- <kbd>Home</kbd> and <kbd>End</kbd> moves focus to the first/last options, respectively.

:::tip Dos
- Do keep dropdown options very concise.
    - If long options are unavoidable, then they can truncate when the dropdown is in a closed state, but they should wrap fully in the open state.
- Do ensure that the clickable area includes the entire selected option area and the icon.
- Consider the most logical order to list options. Options could be listed alphabetically, chronologically, by popularity, etc.
:::

:::danger Don'ts
- Do not start all of the options in a dropdown with the same word or phrase.
- If there are more than 6 options, consider using a combo box instead.
- If there are 2 options, consider using [radio group](radio-group) or [switch](switch) instead.
    - If your interface needs to contain many of these selections, use dropdowns over radio buttons.
- Do not use a dropdown when the user can multi-select options. Use checkboxes instead.
- If it is not absolutely necessary for a user to choose from a predefined set of options, then consider a [text field](text-field) for users to type their own information.
