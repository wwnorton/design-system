"Usable writing" is language designed to help people accomplish their goals quickly and easily.
This includes writing for instructional text, error messages, button text, and other types of interface copy for digital products.

These guidelines are not intended to be a style guide or promote a specific Norton editorial style.
Instead, they are designed to help you write in a way that will feel accessible and enjoyable to your users.

## Principles

1. **Write for all users**

	Our writing is accessible and inclusive.
	We consider people's various contexts, cognitive capacities, disabilities and needs.
	Attention and comprehension are impacted by a variety of things, including physical situation, state of mind, disability, etc.

2. **Put users' needs first**

	We help our users accomplish what they need to do quickly and easily.
	We are mindful of our users' goals and reasons for using our products.

3. **Prioritize trust and respect**

	We earn our users' trust with accurate, clear, concise writing.
	We are straightforward and transparent with our communication.

4. **Less is more**

	We value conciseness.
	We make sure our writing is accurate, clear, and brief, in that order.
	We choose to phrase things in the shortest, simplest way possible while preserving meaning and understanding.

## Dos & Don'ts

### Do

- **Write for all users.**
  All people have a limited ability to process information called cognitive capacity.
  Cognitive capacity increases or decreases for each of us depending on situation, disability, and language fluency, and is depleted more rapidly by complex, difficult, or indirect language.
  Be direct and clear to keep cognitive capacity high.

- **Put users' needs first.**
  Help them accomplish their goals.
  Try to make people's lives easier.
  Respect their time.

- **Be accurate, clear, and brief (in that order).**
  Conciseness is important, but don't sacrifice accuracy or clarity for it.

- **Aim for just enough copy.**
  Use fewer words if possible.
  Understand that people scan more than they read.
  Trust people to figure some things out.

- **Write how you speak.**
  Use plain, direct language and say it out loud.
  Aim for an 8th grade reading level.
  Be consistent and clear.

- **Communicate hierarchy.**
  Use headings to show what's important.
  Chunk longer pieces of content into meaningful units.

- **Keep your own expertise in mind.**
  Ask other (non-Norton) people to read your copy.
  You have insider knowledge that your users don't.

- **Know when to violate traditional writing and grammar rules.**
  Good usable writing isn't always grammatically correct, like colloquial speech.
  For usability, it's best to default to the way most people speak even if it's “incorrect.”

### Don't

- **Don't assume what your users' needs are.**
  Back up your assumptions with data or qualitative research wherever possible.

- **Don't expect people to trust you automatically.**
  We need to create that trust through accurate and understandable writing.

- **Don't over-explain.**
  This diminishes trust.

- **Don't use jargon, internal terms, or unnecessarily big or fancy words.**
  If there's a simpler and less formal way of saying something, do it.

- **Don't create obstacles.**
  Requiring them to read too much text is an obstacle.

- **Don't forget that you're not the only kind of user.**
  This narrows your perspective.
  The goal is to broaden it.

## Accurate, Clear, Brief (in that order)

Good usable writing is:

- **Accurate**
  Accurate copy is true, precise and specific. Above all else, copy should be accurate to maintain people's trust.

- **Clear**
  Clear copy is easily understandable, uses simple words and phrases, and makes logical sense.

- **Brief**
  Brief copy is short and sweet. Use as few words as possible to get the point across in an accurate and clear way.

## Chunking

Chunking is breaking content up into meaningful, distinct units. This helps people understand and remember content and helps communicate hierarchy. “Chunks” should still make sense in the context of the larger whole.

### Chunking best practices

#### Chunk with a purpose

- Don't chunk content randomly. Chunk content into meaningful groups of information.
- Think about chunking like an outline.

<Callout title="Why?" border="left">
Purposeful chunking helps people understand the content because each chunk has a specific goal.
It also makes it easier for people to skim the text for what they need, which is how people read digital copy.
</Callout>

#### Use short paragraphs

- Use short paragraphs with white space between them instead of long paragraphs that become walls of text.

<Callout title="Why?" border="left">
Walls of text are more difficult for people to comprehend. 
They can seem intimidating and time-consuming, which means people are more likely to skip them or even close the page or application completely.
</Callout>

#### Use lists

- Use a list when you have three or more related items.
- Don't include more than seven items in your list if users need to remember each item.

<Callout title="Why?" border="left">
Lists structure content and break information into manageable pieces, which helps comprehension, but using lists doesn't mean we should include dozens of items. Short-term memory is limited. 
Seven items is typically considered the maximum a person can hold in their head at one time.
</Callout>

#### Format data

- Don't use long strings of numbers or data, like 2123545500 or CCTACAGGAT.
- Chunk data with standard formatting and expected symbols, like (212) 354-5500.
- Add white space for long strings of letters or numbers, like CCT ACA GGAT.

<Callout title="Why?" border="left">
Formatting data helps to minimize user error and makes it easier for people to scan.
</Callout>

#### Use clear hierarchies

- Don't group chunks of content randomly.
- Create clear hierarchies with related content grouped together.

<Callout title="Why?" border="left">
Clear hierarchies (see the next section) help people understand relationships and order of importance.
</Callout>

## Hierarchy

Hierarchy communicates meaning and structure through unique, brief headings. It helps people understand the importance of different pieces of content, and allows them to scan and find information that's relevant to them.

Hierarchy is important for everyone, especially people who use assistive technology, like screen readers. These users often navigate a page using headings to find the content they need.

### Hierarchy best practices

#### Use headings

A heading helps to define a specific section of content. You can:

- Use more than one heading on a page.
- Use headings 1 through 6 (without skipping numbers).
- Nest headings.

#### Structure chunked content

- Don't use headings for something other than providing hierarchy.
- Think about your headings as an outline.
  **Ask:** If you only read the headings, could you understand the main ideas?

<Callout title="Why?" border="left">
Headings should help people understand the content's structure and support your chunking (see section above). 
People who use screen readers often use headings to navigate.
Headings makes it easier for them to navigate, find what they're looking for and complete activities.
</Callout>

#### Be concise

- Don't use long sentences as headings.
- Use short phrases or a single word.

<Callout title="Why?" border="left">
Headings should provide a brief overview of the content and be easily scannable.
</Callout>

#### Be specific

- Don't be general, vague, or use words that don't relate to the content being structured.
- Be specific, so the heading provides a clear outline of the content.

<Callout title="Why?" border="left">
Headings should be specific so users can quickly skim for the content they need.
If headings are too general, it will be difficult for people to understand the content's structure and find the information they're looking for.
</Callout>

#### Be unique

- Always use unique headings.
- Never use the same heading twice on the same page.

<Callout title="Why?" border="left">
Unique headings help people find their place.
They are particularly important for screen reader users who often navigate and skim the text by heading.
</Callout>

#### Convey rank

- Don't skip headings (don't jump from a heading 1 to a heading 3).
- Use consecutive headings (heading 1 to heading 2, heading 2 to heading 3)

<Callout title="Why?" border="left">
Screen reader users often use headings to navigate content.
If we skip headings, these users might be confused or think that they are missing content.
</Callout>

- [Using Headings to Convey Meaning and Structure (section)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tips/writing/#use-headings-to-convey-meaning-and-structure)

## Clear words

Clear words refers to the practice of writing clearly and at an appropriate level for your users. Using clear words helps people understand and remember content and learning objectives.

Clear words are beneficial for people with cognitive and learning disabilities, language impairments, memory impairments, and autism. Clear words also benefit people who are tired, distracted, or stressed, people with low literacy, and people who are working outside their first language, such as those who speak English as a second language or use sign language.

### Clear words best practices

#### Use common words

- Don't use complex words and phrases.
- Use familiar, everyday words.
- Define uncommon words if you need to use them.

<Callout title="Why?" border="left">
Even though we're making educational materials, there's no need to make them more complicated or high-level than they need to be.
When we need to use uncommon or technical terms due to the subject matter, define them within the activity.
Don't make people refer back to the textbook or Google for a definition, which takes them away from the product and off the path of accomplishing their goal.
</Callout>

#### Use active voice

- Don't use passive voice (a subject that is a recipient of a verb's action).
  Example:
- Use active language (a subject that acts on a verb).
  Example:

<Callout title="Why?" border="left">
Passive voice makes your writing difficult to understand.
Active voice is easier for everyone to understand, but it's especially beneficial for people with cognitive impairments and non-native English speakers.
</Callout>

#### Avoid technical or wordy language

- Use familiar words or vocabulary.
- Define technical terms the first time you use them (if the subject matter requires them).

<Callout title="Why?" border="left">
Familiar, straightforward language will help people focus on their objective instead of trying to parse difficult words or sentences.
We shouldn't assume that people are familiar with technical terms defined elsewhere.
</Callout>

#### Avoid double negatives

- Don't use double negatives in your writing. This includes

  - No/not + negative adverb (hardly, scarcely)
  - No/not + negative prefix (un-, mis-, in-, non-)
  - No/not + word that has a negative meaning (absence, without, fail)
  - No/not in a prompt + an answer choice with a negative
  - Exceptions within an exception

- Use positive language.
  - No fewer than → At least
  - Not unnecessary → Necessary
  - If you fail to respond you cannot continue → You can continue when you respond

<Callout title="Why?" border="left">
Double negatives are often confusing and obscure the meaning you're trying to convey.
Using positive language is often more precise and concise.
</Callout>

## Clear comprehension

Clear comprehension looks at the purpose of your writing to make sure its intention is clear to people. Clear comprehension is especially important for people with cognitive and learning disabilities, autism, and dyslexia.

**Ask:** Can people easily understand the intended meaning and draw the correct conclusions or perform the necessary actions?

### Clear comprehension best practices

#### Use literal language

- Don't use idioms (a phrase or expression with a figurative, non-literal meaning).
- Use literal language.

  - Idioms: Wrap my head around it → understand.

  Right under your nose → it was obvious.

  Missed the boat → missed the opportunity.

<Callout title="Why?" border="left">
Literal language is clearer and doesn't obscure meaning.
Literal language is easier for people with cognitive impairments, autism, and those who are learning English as a second language, as well as those who are tired, distracted, or stressed.
</Callout>

#### Check readability

- Aim to write text at an 8th grade reading level or lower.
- Review your content with a readability checker, like the Hemingway Editor app.

<Callout title="Why?" border="left">
A readability checker analyzes the length of your words and sentences to assign your content a grade level.
This grade level corresponds to the years of formal education someone would need in order to read and understand the content easily.

If we write at a grade level that is too high for our users, it will be difficult for them to understand and absorb the content.
Writing at an 8th grade level or lower is ideal, even for college students and instructors, and helps us ensure our content is readable by a majority of people.
</Callout>

#### Be concise

- Don't use long sentences.
- Use short, direct sentences that get to the point quickly.

<Callout title="Why?" border="left">
The longer the sentence, the more difficult it will be to understand.
This is most impactful for people with cognitive impairments and non-native English speakers.
</Callout>

#### Expand acronyms on first use

- Avoid using acronyms whenever possible.
- Spell out uncommon acronyms on first use, if you need to use them.
  - For example: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Once you've defined the acronym you can use the acronym on its own.

<Callout title="Why?" border="left">
Expanding an acronym on first use helps people remember what the acronym stands for.
It doesn't assume that they have memorized the acronym and it allows people to keep reading instead of returning to the textbook or Google to find it.
</Callout>

#### Avoid abbreviations

- Avoid abbreviations, especially when they could be confusing or have multiple meanings.
  - For example, “Dr.” could mean “doctor” or “drive.”
- Write out all words when possible, unless the abbreviation is important for the subject matter.

<Callout title="Why?" border="left">
Writing out all abbreviations makes the content more available to all people, but it's particularly helpful for those with cognitive impairments, learning disabilities, and autism.
</Callout>

#### Write in sentence case

- Don't write in all caps or title case.
- Write in sentence case: the first letter of a sentence is capitalized.

<Callout title="Why?" border="left">
All caps and title case are more difficult to read, especially for people with dyslexia.
</Callout>

## Clear names

A clear name assigns a readable label to an important component. These components can include:

- Buttons
- Dropdowns
- Text boxes
- Link text
- Lists

Clear names help people understand what they're supposed to do and what will happen when they take an action. While clear names are helpful to everyone, they're particularly important for people with cognitive, visual, and physical impairments.

### Clear names best practices

#### Be concise

- Don't use long sentences or phrases.
- Use short phrases or a single word.

<Callout title="Why?" border="left">
Too many words will take longer to read and can confuse people.
If you find that your label is more than four words, consider redesigning the action.
</Callout>

#### Make the relationship between labels and components clear

- Don't separate labels from the components they're describing.
- Place the label in or close to the component.

<Callout title="Why?" border="left">
Placing the label and component together helps to associate the label with the component.
This is important for buttons, dropdowns, text boxes, and lists.
It's particularly important to make sure labels and components stay together on small phone screen sizes as well.

This spatial relationship on the screen is important for people with cognitive impairments and people who use screen magnifiers and voice recognition.
This relationship is also essential for people who use screen readers, so it needs to be conveyed through the structure of the code as well.
(Talk to the Accessibility team if you need more information.)
</Callout>

#### Use device-agnostic instructions

- Don't use verbs like tap, drag, type, press, or see.
- Use verbs like select, choose, add, or click.

<Callout title="Why?" border="left">
Providing instructions for one specific device or experience excludes people who use assistive technology and people who are on devices that have different methods of interacting with content (for example, using a mouse vs a phone with a touch screen).
If we limit our instructions, these people will assume that they cannot complete the action being described.
</Callout>

#### Use action verbs for buttons

- Don't use vague or generic button text (like “configure”).
- Use precise, task-focused verbs (like “save”).

<Callout title="Why?" border="left">
Vague or generic labels can make people confused or uncertain about what will happen if they click a button.
Specific action verbs help people remember what they should be doing but they are precise enough that people know what will happen before they click the button.
</Callout>

#### Use meaningful link text

- Don't use ambiguous link text, such as “click here” or “read more.”
- Write link text so that it describes the content of the link target.
  **Ask:** If the link were stand-alone text, would you understand where the link would take you?

<Callout title="Why?" border="left">
When we include a link, we should help people understand where that link will take them before they click it.

People who use screen readers can explore content by reading just the linked text in that content, so we need to make sure that the linked text makes sense outside of the paragraph or sentence where it's located.
</Callout>

- [Better Link Labels: 4Ss for Encouraging Clicks (article)](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/better-link-labels/)

## Clear order

Clear order makes sure that elements on a page are in a reasonable and understandable order, independent of screen size and assistive technology being used.

People expect to read content in a specific order. If we present content in an unexpected way, people could be confused and frustrated when they try to read it or complete an action. People who have cognitive and learning disabilities and people who use screen readers and screen magnifiers are impacted the most by incorrect content order.

### Clear order best practices

#### Left to right, top to bottom

- Follow the typical English reading order: left to right and top to bottom.
- Check your content on a phone so you can determine the content order when everything reflows.

<Callout title="Why?" border="left">
Checking content on your phone will mimic the experience of someone who uses a screen reader, screen magnifier, or text-to-speech reader.
**Ask:** Does the order of your content still make sense when everything reflows in a narrow column?

When placing content for larger screen sizes, people will expect the content to be in a specific order. Review it from left to right, and top to bottom.
**Ask:** Does the content make sense in this order?
</Callout>

#### Put instructions in context

- Don't place instructional text after the action or far away from where people take it.
- Place the instructional text as close to the action as possible.
- Avoid placing unnecessary information or elements between the prompt, instruction, and action.

<Callout title="Why?" border="left">
The order of this content is important.
Prompts and instructions should always come before the action.
If you place them after the action, people can miss them or begin an action without understanding it.
</Callout>

## Avoid relying on visual cues

Visual cues are anything on screen that communicates information based solely on someone's ability to see and interpret that cue.

We want to avoid relying on visual cues because we have users who don't rely on visual cues to understand our content and complete actions. These people use screen readers, screen magnifiers, are color blind, or have cognitive or learning disabilities.

Therefore, using visual-only cues can be confusing and frustrating for these people, or make an action impossible to complete.

### Avoid visual cues best practices

#### Use text to communicate color-coded information

- Don't use color as the only way to communicate information.
- Use a word or phrase to communicate the color-coded information.
  - Instead of just using the color green for correct, include the word “Correct” as well.
  - Instead of just using the color red for incorrect, include the word “Incorrect” as well.

<Callout title="Why?" border="left">
People who live with visual impairments (who use screen readers or screen magnifiers, or who are color blind) will have difficulty understanding visual cues like color-coding, or will not see them at all.
They need another way to receive this information.
</Callout>

#### Don't reference color or text style

- Don't reference color or text style, like “the blue button” or “the bold text.”
- Repeat the content you want to reference or put it in quotes.

<Callout title="Why?" border="left">
People who are colorblind or use screen readers will have difficulty identifying color-coded text.
People who use screen readers will also have difficulty understanding stylized text.
We need to provide another way for them to receive this information.
</Callout>

#### Don't use spatial directions

- Don't use spatial directions, like “on the left” or “above.”
- You can use “before” and “after,” if needed.
- Place content close together so spatial instructions aren't necessary.

<Callout title="Why?" border="left">
Content may reflow based on the user's device or assistive technology, so using spatial directions may be incorrect or confusing in some circumstances.
</Callout>

- [Write Chronologically, Not Spatially (section)](https://alistapart.com/article/standards-for-writing-accessibly/#section3)

## Set your words as text

Your words should almost always be set as selectable text on the screen. “Selectable text” means that you can highlight (or select) the text with your mouse. Setting your words as selectable text means that:

- People who use a screen reader can interact with the text.
- People with low vision can enlarge the text for a zoomed-in reading experience.
- People can change the text to their preferred font in their browser.
- People can use text-to-speech to hear the content read aloud.
- People who are non-native English speakers can translate the text if needed.
- People on their phones will have an easier reading experience.

### Selectable text best practices

- Always set your words as selectable text.
- It is acceptable to set your text as an image if doing so is the only way to present the information accurately. For example:

  - Complex equations
  - Words within music notation
  - Scansion marks

- If you must set text as an image, make sure to write alt text for that image that includes the embedded text.

## Meaningful alternative text

Meaningful alternative text, or “alt text,” refers to the textual representation of an image.

The goal of good alt text is to create an equivalent experience for people who cannot see the image.

### Alternative text best practices

#### Decorative vs. meaningful images

- You don't need to add alt text to decorative images. A decorative image doesn't communicate something important or reveal information.
- Add alt text to meaningful images. A meaningful image tries to explain, represent, or show information.
- Review our alt text guidelines for more information on writing effective alt text. We also have specific alt text examples for 13 different image types (starting on page 3).

<Callout title="Why?" border="left">
Decorative images don't need to be described because they don't add any important or significant information to the experience.
Meaningful images, however, do need a description so screen reader users aren't missing any important information being communicated through the images.
</Callout>

#### Icons

- Add a description to icons that represent important information. The description should be short. For example: if the icon is a warning sign, use “warning.”

<Callout title="Why?" border="left">
We typically add icons in order to help people quickly identify recurring elements, like a specific feature box or question.
We need to add a description to these icons so people with visual impairments are given the same context that's being communicated by the icon.
</Callout>
